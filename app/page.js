            A digital twin is a software test environment for a real process.
            SAGE uses several levels of simulation to expose weak assumptions
            and compare plans. The results support review; they do not control a
            physical machine.

              <p>
                The identification score asks how well combined virtual sensors
                distinguish the hidden condition inside the simulation; higher
                is better, and 0.4 is a study comparison line, not a physical
                safety limit. At 4× modeled transport latency, the mean score
                was {publicFusionSummary.x4IdentMean.toFixed(2)}. Low-scoring
                episodes still rose from{" "}

          <p>
            SAGE is seeking precision manufacturers, CNC programmers,
            applications engineers, research partners, and technical teams who
            want to evaluate an evidence-linked planning workflow offline,
            without connecting it to equipment.
